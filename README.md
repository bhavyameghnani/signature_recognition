# Signature Recognition
One can clone the repositories using the following commands
```
git clone https://github.com/parth-dedhia/signature_recognition.git
cd signature_recognition
```
#

Here you will see a couple of directories and a couple of python files and json files.
The folders contain the dataset and are named as follows

> Dataset - This folder contains four dataset folder in which the model is trained on the dataset1
> TestDriveData1 - Contains a set of 10 test images
> TestDriveData2 - Contains a set of 10 test images

The capsnet.ipnyb contains the code which is to runned
On running code a separate folder called as the output folder will be created and in this folder checkpoints and other tensorboard requirements will be created
The checkpoints are loaded during the test time for loading the pre-trained variables.
# More on Checkpoints
The checkpoints are created by the code to store the variables. The purpose of this is to avoid running the entire model during test time.
There are few other files also generated by tensorflow.
One can see more about these checkpoints in the tensorflow documentation

# Running the code
One can simply open the ipython notebook.
Its is suggestible to use the free GPU and TPU provided by google - Google Colaboratory.
Since the model consist of multiplication of rank 4 matrices, it would be suggestible to use a GPU if thr code is run on a local computer.
# Running the Google Colab
Here one needs to take care of the directory structure while runing the code , in order to do so one can simply use the following commands
```
cd /<desired-directory>
ls
```
on reachindd the directory in which the .ipynb file is available
one can simply run the code
